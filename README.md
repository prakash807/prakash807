- 👋 Hi, I’m @prakash807
- 👀 I’m interested in programming, physics and mathematics, particularly the application of these subjects to machine learning in the context of healthcare, such as through medical imaging for diagnosis
- 🌱 Some concepts I have enjoyed learning about through research and school are hyperparameters of a convolutional neural networks, their impact in ultrasound image segmentation, and the use of segmentation for creating medical imaging phantoms
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on hackathon projects using MATLAB, Java, Python and C
- 📫 Feel free to reach out to me through my email prakash.h1357@gmail.com or discord @prakash807
